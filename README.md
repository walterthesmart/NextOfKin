# Next of Kin Smart Contract

The Next of Kin smart contract is built on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity language. This contract allows users to deposit their STX tokens and assign recipients who will receive the tokens in the event of user inactivity for a specified period. 

## Key Features

1. **STX Deposits**: Users can deposit their STX tokens into the smart contract securely.
2. **Assign Recipients**: Users can assign up to 10 recipients with their respective amounts.
3. **Inactivity Detection**: The smart contract uses chainhooks to detect user inactivity for a year. Chainhooks target events on the Bitcoin and Stacks blockchain, important to our use case, to trigger actions based on those events. [Learn more about chainhooks](https://docs.hiro.so/stacks/chainhook/installation).
4. **Automatic Transfers**: Once the inactivity period elapses, the smart contract automatically sends the STX to the assigned recipients.
5. **Future Feature - STX Staking**: In future updates, there will be a feature that allows users to stake their STX in pools.

## How It Works

1. **Deposit STX**: Users deposit their STX tokens into the smart contract.
2. **Assign Recipients**: Users can assign up to 10 recipients, specifying the amount each should receive.
3. **Inactivity Monitoring**: The smart contract monitors user activity. If there is no activity for one year, it triggers the chainhook.
4. **Trigger Action**: The chainhook detects the inactivity and triggers the transfer of STX to the recipients.
5. **Future Staking**: Users will be able to stake their STX in pools to earn rewards in future updates.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Deploy the smart contract on the Stacks blockchain.
3. Use the provided functions to deposit STX and assign recipients.
4. Monitor your activity to prevent unintended transfers.
